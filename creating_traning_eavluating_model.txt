Program Documentation
This program performs image classification using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model on a dataset containing images of different classes. It trains the model on the training dataset, evaluates its performance on the validation dataset, and saves the trained model for future use. It also provides the functionality to classify new images using the trained model.

Requirements
a. Matplotlib (plt)
b. Seaborn (sns)
c. Keras (keras)
d. OpenCV (cv2)
e. NumPy (np)
f. Scikit-learn (sklearn)
g. TensorFlow (tf)

Make sure these libraries are installed before running the program.

Usage
1.  Import the required libraries
2.  Set the labels and image size
3.  Load the dataset
4.  Prepare the training and validation data
5.  Build and compile the model
6.  Train the model
7.  Visualize training and validation accuracy and loss
8.  Evaluate the model on the validation dataset
9.  Save and load the trained model
10. Classify a new image using the trained model

Conclusion
This program provides a pipeline for image classification using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. It loads the dataset, prepares the data, builds and compiles the model, trains and evaluates it, and saves the trained model for future use. It also includes the functionality to classify new images using the trained model. Customize the program according to your dataset and requirements.
